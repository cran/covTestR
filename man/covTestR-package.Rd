\title{Covariance Matrix Testing Functions}
\description{
Testing functions for Covariance Matrices. These tests 
include high-dimension homogeneity of covariance matrix testing described 
by Schott (2007) \doi{10.1016/j.csda.2007.03.004} and high-dimensional 
one-sample tests of covariance matrix structure described by 
Fisher, et al. (2010) \doi{10.1016/j.jmva.2010.07.004}. Covariance matrix
tests use C++ to speed performance and allow larger data sets.
